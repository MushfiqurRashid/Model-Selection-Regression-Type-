# Model-Selection-Regression-Type-
Here I train the models with the same dataset called Data.csv. And after training the dataset I can see that Random Forest Regressor's R2 score is 0.9615908334363876. Which is the best score of the models. And from this observation I can easily say that Random Forest Resgressor is the best for the dataset.
